Explanation:

Blockquote (<blockquote>):The <blockquote> tag is used to define a section that is quoted from another source. This is typically used for longer quotations. You can optionally use the cite attribute to specify the source of the quote.

Inline Quotation (<q>):The <q> tag is used for short, inline quotations within a paragraph. The browser usually adds quotation marks around the text enclosed in <q>.

Abbreviation (<abbr>):The <abbr> tag is used to represent an abbreviation or acronym, providing the full form of the text in the title attribute. When the user hovers over the abbreviation, the full form is displayed. For example, <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO.
