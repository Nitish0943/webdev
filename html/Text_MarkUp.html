<!-- Explanation:

Headings (<h1> to <h6>): Headings are used to define the titles or subtitles in your content, with <h1> being the most important and <h6> the least.

Paragraph (<p>): The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text. It's used to separate blocks of text into readable sections.

Preformatted Text (<pre>): The <pre> tag is used for preformatted text. It preserves white spaces and line breaks as they appear in the code.

Line Break (<br>): The <br> tag is used to insert a line break within a paragraph, forcing the text to continue on the next line.

Horizontal Rule (<hr>): The <hr> tag is used to create a horizontal rule, which can be used to separate content sections. -->
